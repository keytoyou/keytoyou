        <p>
          Our project is centralized on improving the moods of our users.  By selecting an emotion on our question page, we generate a quote from our databases to assist in their needs.  Whether feeling stressed or sad, we attempt to alleviate the worries for our users even if for just a second.

        <h2> <b>Why We Created This </b> </h2>
        <p>
          This summer we participated in the Girls Who Code summer immersion program where we learned a variety of coding topics. From creating sidescroller games to programing robots to dance to music we had a blast. As for this website, we both have a big appreciation for quotes and wanted to incorporate that into our project. We have had so much fun creating something that encourages others to reach their fullest potential.

        <h2><b> FAQ </b></h2>
        <p>
          How do I get a quote? :
          By navigating to the question page, one should choose a landscape representative of their current mood.  From there they will be navigated to a quote tailored to your needs.
          <br>
          <br>
          How do I return to the home page? :
          By clicking our logo, located on the upper left of any page, you can return to the home screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          How does it work? : 
          Each quote is categorized by mood in arrays which we created an algorithm to randomly select a quote from and display it on the webpage.
